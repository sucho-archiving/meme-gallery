      <h2>About the Meme Wall</h2>
    </header>
    <p>
      The Meme Wall is a project by the Saving Ukrainian Digital Heritage Online
      (SUCHO) initiative, an international volunteer initiative to preserve
      Ukrainian cultural heritage by archiving websites of Ukrainian cultural
      institutions and prevent data loss resulting from Russia’s war on Ukraine.
      For more about SUCHO, visit <a href="https://sucho.org/">sucho.org</a>.

    <p>
      Ukrainian war memes are an important born-digital element of contemporary
      culture. They are disseminated mainly through social media and transmit
      very powerful war-related messages in a playful manner. Because memes are
      strongly rooted in current events and ideas, their life span is very short
      and if not preserved, they will be lost. To preserve this cultural
      phenomenon SUCHO has begun building an archival collection of visual
      internet memes related to the Russo-Ukrainian war. The collecting is
      carried out by harvesting social media accounts dedicated to memes and by
      manual submission of individual memes via a public Google form. Each meme
      is described using a complex metadata structure. The collection can be
      previewed as an interactive “SUCHO Meme Wall”, where memes can be filtered
      or searched by content, language and template as well as by the names of
      individuals and countries mentioned.

      <h2>About the Site</h2>
    </header>
    <p>
      This site is built directly from curated submissions to <a
        title="SUCHO Meme Submission Form"
        href={submissionFormUrl}>the Google Form</a
      >. At build-time, the contents of the sheet is fetched and parsed, and the
      source images are downloaded from the Google Drive folder. The images are
      then processed to create the versions in multiple sizes/formats required
      to create the site. Additional material to complete the various glossaries
      is fetched, parsed, and incorporated into the site from a number of
      minimally structured Google Docs
    </p>
    <p>
      The front-end site itself is created in HTML, CSS, vanilla Javascript, and
      a little <a title="Svelte" href="https://svelte.dev/">Svelte</a> using the
      <a title="Astro" href="https://astro.build/">Astro</a> web framework. The site
      is hosted on GitHub Pages and <a
        href="https://github.com/sucho-archiving/meme-wall/"
        title="SUCHO Meme Wall Repository">the source is available on GitHub</a
      >.
